# Components

This directory contains reusable React components.

## Structure

- Keep components organized by feature or type
- Each component should have its own file/folder
- Consider co-locating tests, styles, and related assets with components

## Example

```
components/
  Button/
    Button.tsx
    Button.test.tsx
  Card/
    Card.tsx
```
